# Professional Python Programming

What really separates world-class performers from everybody else is deliberate practice. - [Geoff Covin](https://geoffcolvin.com/books/talent-is-overrated/)

Nobody can learn swimming or playing tennis only from books. A good book is about what to practice and how to practice.

## Why Another Python Book?

> Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning. - Rick Cook

This is an introductory Python programming book for _knowledge workers_ who are professional data analysts or application developers. Unlike most existing Python programming books, it teaches Python programming in a professional way. Here the word "professional" means the Pythonic way of programming bigger and better idiot-proof applications. Knowledge workers learn Python programming to solve non-trivial real world problems. The book teaches essential programming concepts and skills to effectively write professional programs that are correct, easy to maintain, easy to test and has reasonable performance.

## Features

In addition to the basic Python programming concepts in Part I, it covers the following topics that are important for a professional programmer:

- best programming practices such as naming, design, documentation, same level abstraction, small functions, separation of concerns, and continues refactoring.
- Python data model.
- advanced but important Python constructs such as property, decorator, descriptor, and metaclass.
- type hints.
- test driven development.
- application tracing.
- Python performance issues and tradeoffs.
