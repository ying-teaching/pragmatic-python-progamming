# Bigram Language Model

This is based on Andrej's Youtube video [The spelled-out intro to language modeling: building makemore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaCmpygFfXo).

It explains how to develop a simple bigram language model using a neural network. It covers model training, sampling, and the evaluation of a loss function.
