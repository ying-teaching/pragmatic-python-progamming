# Professional Programming

This part is based on [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). For absolute beginners or students from other majors (economics, biology, communication, etc), some supplementary materials and alternatives are added.

## 1. The Missing Semester of Your CS Education

To be really good at coding, you must be an advanced user of your computer. The [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) is an introduction course in MIT. It has the text and videos of learning the basic tools for programming. The first 6 lessons are useful. You won't regret if you learn it.

## 2. A basic introduction to Programming

The recommended course is [Berkeley CS 61A](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E).

Two alternative easy course for beginner:

- Harvard [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
- MIT Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python. [Edx online course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7) or [MIT open courseware 6.0001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).

A classic, really good one if you have a little bit programming experience or is a good learner. You will learn the essential programming concepts when you complete this course.

- [STRUCTURE AND INTERPRETATION OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/)

## 3. Computer Systems

You should learn the computer architecture from a programmer's point of view. It might be hard for non-CS or non-EE students. You don't need to understand everything and you can learn it again after you have some programming experience. You may want to learn a little bit C programming before this course.

The following two should be fine for beginner.

- [C Programming For Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners-/). You often find good deal/coupons for Udemy course with big discount -- don't pay the full price.
- Easy one: [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

Pick the following one if you like challenges:

- A comprehensive one: [CMU Introduction to Computer Systems](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/index.html).

## 4. Algorithm and Data Structure

Personally I like [Coursera Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) taught by Stanford Professor Tim Roughgarden. His four algorithm textbooks are easy to digest than other more famous algorithm books.

Alternatively, [Analysis of Algorithms Lectures](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/videos/)

## 5 Operating Systems

- Three pieces: [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/). It has a free ebook. [Free Youtube lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDW872573QAb4bj0URobvQTD41IV6gRkx).

## 6 Computer Network

[Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/index.php) is a good and easy to read book. The site has links to online lectures/labs.

## 7 Database

There are good comments about [CMU15-445 Database Systems](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2022/). They put [lectures in Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSE8ODhjZXjaKScG3l0nuOiDTTqpfnWFf).

## 8 Distributed Systems

The book [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://smile.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable-ebook/dp/B06XPJML5D/) is highly recommended. The author has [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4KdJM8LzAMecwInbBK5GJ3Anz-ts75RQ) is strongly recommended.

## 9 Language and Compilers

[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) is a good introduction to compilers and is easy to read. It should be enough for most programmers.

## 10 Theory of Computation

This is optional. Those who know theories can think at different level of abstraction. [THEORY OF COMPUTATION](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-404j-theory-of-computation-fall-2020/)
