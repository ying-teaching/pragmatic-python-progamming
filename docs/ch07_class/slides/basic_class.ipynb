    "Every Python data is an object. Except literal values of built-in types, all objects are created from classes. In object-oriented programming (OOP), these objects are called _instances_. A class, working as a template, defines the attributes and methods that its instances can have. A class is the type of its instances."

    "\n",
    "There are many reasons for class and the object-oriented programming paradigm. Some common reasons for Python OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- People use the concepts of class (type) and instance in real life.\n",
    "- OOP brings the benefits of inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.\n",
    "- In Python, class provides a unified method to allows developers to create new data types that organize data and functions in a flexible way."

    "### 1.2 Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes have the parent-child relationship. A __subclass__ (or __child class__) can inherits from one or more __superclasses__ (or __parent class__). A superclass can be inherited by many subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called implementation inheritance because a subclass inherits all attributes and methods defined in its superclass code. A subclass can choose to override the inherited attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, inheritance reduces redundant code in its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, inheritance, especially deep class hierarchy, creates strong coupling among classes. When there is a change, it is hard to change the involved classes."

    "\n",
    "The implementation of attributes and methods could be changed without affecting its use if the class interface doesn't change. Python allows you to implement attributes using methods -- the so-called __uniform access principle__.\n",

    "Encapsulation is a desired objective. In practice, it is hard to define a flexible interface that works in different contents. "

    "- composite data that consists of a collection of attributes. It is often called __data classes__. The purpose is to make it easy to use the composite data and its parts.\n",
    "- stateful objects. Some object operations are stateful, i.e., each method call may return different results because the internal states may change in a method call. A user interface is a typical stateful object. People avoid stateful objects in multi-thread computation because it may introduce subtle concurrent bugs.\n",
    "- combination of data and relevant operations. For example, a complex number and common complex number operations are defined in a `complex` class. Usually the class data is immutable to distinguish it from a stateful object."
