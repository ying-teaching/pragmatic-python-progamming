    "  - `__init__.py`: it is an empty file to flag the parent folder as a Python package.\n",
    "  - `asgi.py`: it is an entry point file for ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) web server. ASGI support asynchronous operations that might have better performance for certain applications at the cost of complex code and logic. Most Web applications don't use it.\n",
    "  - `setting.py`: it contains settings (configurations) for this project. For example, you should change the `TIME_ZONE = \"America/Los_Angeles\"` if your site is located iLos Angeles, CA, USA. You can find valid time zone names in [Time Zone List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).\n",
